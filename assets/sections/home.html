        <strong>Hi there!</strong> I'm an undergraduate student at the Indian
        Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER) Bhopal, India, and
        an aspiring astrophysicist. Ever since I can remember, I've been
        fascinated by the wonders of the universe—black holes, pulsars,
        gravitational waves, and the mysterious atmospheres of distant
        exoplanets.
      </p>

      <p>
        During my time at IISER, I've had the chance to dive deep into these
        interests through academics and internships, especially working on PTA
        exoplanets. It's been an incredible experience collaborating with
        amazing researchers and learning from them.
      </p>

      <p>
        Astronomy has always been more than just a field of study for me—it's a
        lifelong passion. I'm excited to keep exploring the cosmos and
        contributing to uncovering its many secrets.
      </p>

      <p><strong>I use Arch BTW! </strong></p>

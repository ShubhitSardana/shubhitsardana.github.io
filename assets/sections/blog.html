      This is where I share what I'm working on, thinking about, or just find
      fascinating. You'll find a mix of astrophysics, cosmology, Linux tweaks,
      coding experiments, and the occasional rant about how weird (and
      wonderful) the universe is.
    </p>

    <p>
      I'm especially into things like gravitational waves, pulsar timing arrays,
      and anything that helps us understand how the universe is expanding. If
      you're curious about how cosmic clocks might help fix the Hubble tension —
      you're in the right place.
    </p>

    <p>
      I'm also a bit of a Linux distro-hopper (okay, maybe more than a bit).
      I've tried most of them, broken quite a few, and learned a lot in the
      process. Expect posts on setups, configs, and occasional terminal
      wizardry.
    </p>

    <p>
      This blog is kind of my personal logbook — research, projects, papers,
      late-night thoughts, and tech setups all end up here. If any of that
      sounds interesting, stay tuned.

      <h4>Is Dark Energy a Cosmic Illusion?</h4>
      <time datetime="2024-11-30">Mar 7, 2025</time>
      <p class="interesting-research-text">
        New analysis of the Pantheon+ Type Ia supernova dataset suggests the
        "timescape cosmology" model may explain cosmic acceleration better than
        the standard ΛCDM model. Instead of invoking dark energy, timescape
        attributes the effect to "backreaction" from the universe's
        inhomogeneous structure—voids expanding faster than dense regions. The
        improved statistical approach shows strong evidence favoring timescape,
        even at high redshifts. While not disproving dark energy, this
        challenges the ΛCDM paradigm and may reshape our understanding of cosmic
        expansion.

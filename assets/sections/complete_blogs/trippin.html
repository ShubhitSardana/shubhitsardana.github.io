            unlocked the same door—the ultimate nature of reality?</strong
          >
        </p>

        <p>
          I recently explored accounts of experiences with DMT
          (N,N-Dimethyltryptamine), a powerful psychoactive substance. What's
          astonishing is how deeply these modern narratives mirror the profound
          descriptions of consciousness found in ancient Indian yogic and
          Vedantic texts, especially the <strong>Mandukya Upanishad</strong>. It
          seems as though two distinct paths—one rooted in modern chemistry, the
          other in ancient philosophy—might converge upon the same timeless
          truth.

        <h2>The DMT Journey and the Echoes of Non-Duality</h2>

        <p>
          Individuals who have journeyed with DMT often describe a radical
          dissolution of the self, an overwhelming sensation of oneness with the
          universe, or a profound merging with a universal "source." They speak
          of "waking up" from our perceived reality, realizing our world is more
          dream-like than we believe, and attaining a state of ineffable bliss.
          These are not mere poetic metaphors; they resonate with the core
          tenets of
          <strong>Advaita Vedanta</strong>, a school of Hindu philosophy.
          Advaita Vedanta teaches that the individual self or soul (Atman) and
          the ultimate reality (Brahman) are not separate entities but are, in
          fact, one and the same. According to this philosophy, the illusion of
          separation, a concept known as <em>Maya</em>, is what prevents us from
          perceiving this fundamental unity.

        <h2>The Four States of Consciousness: The Mandukya Upanishad</h2>

        <p>
          The <strong>Mandukya Upanishad</strong>, though comprising only twelve
          verses, masterfully dissects this truth by exploring the four states
          of consciousness the Atman experiences. These states, or
          <em>avasthas</em>, provide a framework for understanding the layers of
          our reality.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>1. Vaishvanara (The Waking State):</strong> This is the state
          of outward-turned consciousness, where we perceive the external world
          through our senses. The Upanishad describes this as
          <em>bahish-prajna</em> (outward-knowing). (Mandukya Upanishad, Verse
          3)
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>2. Taijasa (The Dreaming State):</strong> Here, awareness is
          turned inward, experiencing a world constructed of mental impressions
          and memories. This is the state of
          <em>antah-prajna</em> (inward-knowing). (Mandukya Upanishad, Verse 4)
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>3. Prajna (The Deep Sleep State):</strong> In this state,
          there are no dreams and no objects of perception. It is a state of
          undifferentiated consciousness, a seed of awareness without division.
          (Mandukya Upanishad, Verse 5)
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong
            >The common thread through these three states is the persistent,
            underlying awareness of existence—the fundamental feeling of "I
            am."</strong
          >
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>4. Turiya (The Fourth):</strong> This is not truly a state but
          the foundational reality that underlies and transcends the other
          three. It cannot be perceived by the senses, described in language, or
          conceived by the mind. It is beyond all duality and is identified as
          the true Self (Atman).
        </p>

        <p>
          The Mandukya Upanishad describes Turiya with breathtaking clarity:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
          It is not that which is conscious of the internal subjective world,
          nor that which is conscious of the external world, nor that which is
          conscious of both, nor that which is a mass of consciousness, nor that
          which is simple consciousness, nor is it unconsciousness. It is unseen
          by any sense-organ, beyond empirical dealings, incomprehensible by the
          mind, uninferable, unthinkable, indescribable, essentially by of the
          Self alone, negation of all phenomena, the peaceful, the auspicious
          and the nondual. This is what is considered as the Fourth (Turiya).
          This is the Atman and this is to be realised.” (Mandukya Upanishad,
          Verse 7)
        </blockquote>

        <p>
          Modern psychology and neuroscience might label the dissolution of self
          often experienced with DMT as "ego death." Vedanta, on the other hand,
          describes the realization of one's true nature as Self-realization
          (<em>Atma-jnana</em>), a process that inherently involves transcending
          the limited ego. Perhaps these are simply two different lenses—one
          chemical, one conscious—observing the same ineffable truth.
        </p>

        <h2>The "Spirit Molecule" and the Brain's Mysteries</h2>

        <p>
          Interestingly, scientific research confirms that the human body can
          naturally produce DMT. Its exact purpose as an endogenous compound
          remains a topic of scientific inquiry. Speculative theories, notably
          from Dr. Rick Strassman, author of "DMT: The Spirit Molecule," propose
          that elevated levels of DMT might be released during pivotal life
          moments such as birth and death, and potentially during deep
          meditative states. While evidence has been found for increased DMT
          concentrations in the brains of rodents during cardiac arrest, there
          is currently no conclusive scientific proof that meditation
          significantly increases DMT production in humans, or that the pineal
          gland produces enough of it to cause psychoactive effects. Still, this
          has led to a fascinating hypothesis: what if our normal waking
          consciousness is a form of filtered reality, and substances like DMT
          temporarily disable this filter? Could the brain's natural regulatory
          mechanisms be analogous to the Vedantic concept of Maya?
        </p>

        <h2>The Riddle of Oneness and Individuality</h2>

        <p>
          This line of thought raises a profound paradox. If a few individuals
          can use a substance like DMT to access a "higher" plane of reality,
          what does that imply for the rest of humanity? If our reality is akin
          to a dream from which one can "wake up," are the rest of us merely
          non-player characters (NPCs) in that individual's dream? How can we
          all be one unified entity, as Advaita Vedanta's core principle of
          non-duality (<em>Advaita</em> literally means "not two") asserts, if
          some can escape this shared reality while others remain?
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>An Example for Computer Geeks: </strong>To grapple with this,
          a modern analogy might be helpful: a powerful computer running
          multiple virtual machines (VMs). In essence, all the VMs are
          expressions of the same underlying hardware, but from their individual
          perspectives, they operate as separate and distinct systems. If these
          VMs could communicate, they would likely be unaware of their
          fundamental interconnection. The virtualization software creates the
          illusion of separation.
        </p>

        <p>
          If the ultimate reality, Brahman, is present in everything, and in
          fact, <em>is</em> everyone and everything, then when a person
          experiences enlightenment, they are essentially freed from the
          "illusion" of being a separate VM and merge back into the main
          operating system—the source code of existence itself.
        </p>

        <h2>Maya and Leela: The Divine Play of Consciousness</h2>

        <p>
          The Upanishads offer another beautiful perspective through the
          concepts of <em>Maya</em> and <em>Leela</em>. Brahman's creative
          power, Maya, is the very force that veils the singular reality, making
          the One appear as the many. This entire cosmic unfolding is described
          as Leela, or divine play. The Taittiriya Upanishad suggests that in
          the beginning, the Absolute was alone and desired, "May I be many, may
          I grow forth." (Taittiriya Upanishad, 2.6.1) Through this divine play,
          Brahman experiences its own infinite potential through a myriad of
          forms. We, as individual nodes of consciousness, gather a universe of
          experiences—joy, sorrow, love, and grief. Upon enlightenment, these
          experiences are re-integrated into the whole of Brahman, enriching the
          cosmic consciousness. In essence, we are the co-creators of our
          reality, temporarily veiled from our true, all-encompassing Self. The
          Brihadaranyaka Upanishad beautifully states, "This (self) was indeed
          Brahman in the beginning. It knew only Itself as, 'I am Brahman'.
          Therefore It became all." (Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, 1.4.10)

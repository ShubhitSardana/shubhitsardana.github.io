        Helipspheric Delsity Mapping Using IPS for correcting DM excess in
        Pulsar
      </h4>
      <p class="project-description">
        The Ooty Radio Telescope (ORT) regularly observes interplanetary
        scintillation (IPS) of compact radio sources, enabling measurements of
        plasma density fluctuations in the inner heliosphere—the region between
        the Earth and the Sun. Pulsars located near the ecliptic plane exhibit
        annual variations in their dispersion measure (DM) due to excess
        electron density along the line of sight caused by the heliosphere. My
        thesis focuses on correlating these IPS‑based heliospheric density
        measurements with DM variations observed in the open‑access IPTA DR2
        pulsar timing data set. The goal is to improve our understanding of
        heliospheric contributions to pulsar timing noise, which is crucial for
        enhancing the sensitivity of Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTAs) in the search
        for nanohertz‑frequency gravitational waves.

        Resolving the Hubble Tension using Pulsar Timing
      </h4>
      <p class="project-description">
        This project explores measuring the Hubble constant using pulsar timing
        data, independent of traditional cosmological probes. By modeling the
        effect of cosmic expansion on pulsar time-of-arrival (TOA) measurements,
        I simulate the Hubble-induced delay and extract its signature from
        residuals using quadratic fitting. This offers an alternative pathway to
        address the Hubble tension.

      <h4 class="project-title">Solar Wind Gaussian Process (SWGP) Modeling</h4>
      <p class="project-description">
        I am working on the Gaussian Process modelling of solar wind effects in
        pulsar timing arrays (PTAs). This involves analyzing the influence of
        solar wind plasma on pulsar timing data and separating its effects from
        other noise sources. My research focuses on understanding correlations
        between solar wind parameters and their impact on pulsar timing
        precision.

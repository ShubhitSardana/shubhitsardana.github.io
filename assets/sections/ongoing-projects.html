      <h4>Resolving the hubble tension using Pulsar Timing</h4>

        <p>
          This project explores the possibility of measuring the Hubble constant
          using pulsar timing data, independent of traditional cosmological
          probes. By modeling the effect of cosmic expansion on pulsar
          time-of-arrival (TOA) measurements, I simulate the Hubble-induced
          delay and extract its signature from residuals using quadratic
          fitting. This approach offers an alternative pathway to address the
          Hubble tension and complements existing methods such as using Type 1A
          supernovae as standard candles.

        <h4>Solar Wind Gaussian Process (SWGP) Modeling</h4>
        <div>

          <p>
            I am currently working on the Gaussian Process modelling solar wind
            effects in pulsar timing arrays (PTAs). This involves analyzing the
            influence of solar wind plasma on pulsar timing data, separating its
            effects from other noise sources like dispersion measure variations
            and red noise. My research focuses on understanding correlations
            between solar wind parameters, electron column density, and their
            impact on pulsar timing precision.

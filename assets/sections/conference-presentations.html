      <h4>InPTA bi-weekly meeting</h4>

        <p>
          Presented in the InPTA's bi-weekly meeting focusing on the importance
          of including the effects of solar wind in the pulsar timing. Mentioned
          the importance of integrating the effects due to solar wind plasma and
          electron density on the dispersion measure (dm) of signals from
          pulsars which lie very close to the solar disk. Showed the results
          from the first version of the script I built to analyse this process.

      <h4>Gravitational-wave Analysis Telecon</h4>

        <p>
          I gave a presentation in the GWA's bi-weekly Telecon. The presentation
          was focused on the key findings from the work done under the
          supervision of Dr. Boris Goncharov. This work has also been published
          in the form of two academic research papers.

        <h4>EPTA-wide Telecon</h4>

          <p>
            I gave a presentation in the EPTA-wide Telecon which is a bi-weekly
            EPTA meeting. The presentation was focused on the Ensemble noise
            properties of Pulsars, a research work that I did under the
            supervision of Dr. Boris Goncharov. This work is also published as a
            research paper.
